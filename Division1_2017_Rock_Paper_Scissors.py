Rock Paper Scissors

Today we have a tournament of Rock Paper Scissors! 
Given an input of players and their random list of options 
return the result of the tournament following the rules of 
RPS below. Assume each round the player uses the next option 
that isnâ€™t used in their list. If there is a tie, then both 
players move on to their next option. You will not return 
ties in your tournament results.

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Scissors

Constraints
The first line tells you how many players there are in this tournament.
Each line in the output represents a round in the tournament and we want to see every round and 
the move that the player used for that round. Assume that there are enough players to make an even tournament like below.
To build your bracket, you are to pair up 2 players in numerical order, i.e. 1 and 2, 3 and 4 etc.
Each player is represented by an integer and each game option is represented by a single uppercase letter.
The goal is to end up with one winner, and also show what move he would use in that last round.
Each player has enough options to win.
